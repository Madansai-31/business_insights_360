# 🧭 Business Insights 360

## 📘 Project Description
Atliq Hardware, a global consumer electronics company, relied on Excel for analytics, resulting in poor insights and losses in the LATAM region. <br>
To solve this, a Power BI solution — **Business Insights 360** — was developed to deliver a unified, interactive view across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive dashboards. <br>
The project involved cleaning and transforming data using Power Query, building a star schema model, and creating KPIs with DAX for metrics like Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Net Profit %, and Forecast Accuracy. <br>
The dashboard helped executives identify low-performing regions, optimize costs, and make data-driven decisions through real-time analytics and storytelling-driven insights.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Atliq Hardware’s rapid expansion across global markets increased data complexity. Their existing Excel-based reports were: <br>
- Difficult to consolidate from multiple sources <br>
- Inefficient for trend analysis and forecasting <br>
- Unable to provide real-time insights into profitability and regional performance <br>

To overcome these challenges, the company implemented a centralized Power BI solution integrating multiple data sources and dynamic visuals for management reporting.
